# Some other key functionality in NIMBLE

 - Dirichlet process and related models for Bayesian nonparametric mixture modeling
 - Calling out to external C/C++ or external R code in a nimbleFunction via `nimbleExternalCall` and `nimbleRcall`.
 - Conditional auto-regressive (CAR) models for spatial and other contexts

# Getting help with and contributing to NIMBLE

  - User manual ([html](https://r-nimble.org/html_manual/cha-welcome-nimble.html) or [pdf](https://r-nimble.org/manuals/NimbleUserManual.pdf)) 
  - Announcements: [nimble-announce Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nimble-announce)
 - User	support/discussion: [nimble-users Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nimble-users)
  - Write an algorithm using NIMBLE! We're happy to work with you to provide help.
    - Distribute as your own R package that depends on NIMBLE.
    - Make available as stand-alone code on your or our website.
  - Help with development of NIMBLE: email nimble.stats@gmail.com or see [github.com/nimble-dev/nimble](https://github.com/nimble-dev/nimble)

We try to be responsive on the the user support/discussion list, and welcome others to contribute answers as well. 

# Ongoing work in NIMBLE

  - Continued development of Bayesian nonparametrics (Claudia Wehrhahn and Abel Rodriguez @ UC Santa Cruz)
  - Automatic derivatives (coming very soon):
    - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
    - Laplace approximation and related quadrature methods
    - Maximum (marginal) likelihood
  - Improved scalability (in progress)
    - Faster model and algorithm building and compilation
    - Parallelization in nimbleFunctions
    - Improved linear algebra (including sparse matrices)
  - Improved workflow (in progress)
    - Saving and re-loading work
    - More flexible nimbleFunction syntax
    - Better nimbleFunction error trapping/messages

# Big-picture goals

  - enhancing methodological "tech transfer"
  - improving reproducibility of research that uses hierarchical models and of methods research for hierarchical models
  - enabling easier comparison of methods
